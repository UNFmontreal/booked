                    all examples of resources. Schedules are where available time slots are defined. All resources must

                <h2>Setting up Schedules</h2>

                <p>
                    When installing Booked, a default schedule will be created with out of the box settings. From the
                    Schedules menu option you can view and edit attributes of the current schedules.
                </p>

                <h3>Standard Layouts</h3>
                <p>Schedules can be displayed starting on any day of the week and for any number of days. For a schedule to
                    display starting on the current day, set the
                    Starts On option to Today.</p>

                <p>Each schedule must have a layout defined for it. This controls the availability of the resources on that
                    schedule. Clicking the Change Layout link will bring up the layout editor. Here you can create and change
                    the
                    time slots that are available for reservation and blocked from reservation. There is no restriction on the
                    slot
                    times, but you must provide slot values for all 24 hours of the day, one per line. Also, the time format
                    must be
                    in 24 hour time.
                    You can also provide a display label for any or all slots, if you wish.</p>

                <p>A slot without a label should be formatted like this: 10:25 - 16:50</p>

                <p>A slot with a label should be formatted like this: 10:25 - 16:50 Schedule Period 4</p>

                <p>Below the slot configuration windows is a slot creation wizard. This will set up available slots at the given
                    interval between the start and end times.</p>

                <h3>Custom Layouts</h3>
                <p>You can create a fully customized schedule layout by switching to the custom layout option. This will let you
                    set specific times on specific dates to be reservable. Switching to a custom layout will remove all standard layout slots.</p>

                <h3>Schedule Administrators</h3>

                <p>A group of users may be set up with permission to manage resources. In order for a group to be set as the
                    schedule administrator the group must first
                    be granted the Schedule Administrator role. This is configured from the Groups admin tool. Once that role
                    has been added, the group will be
                    available in the Manage Schedules tool.</p>

                <p>Schedule Administrators have the same capabilities as Application Administrators for any resource that is on
                    a schedule which the group is assigned
                    to. They can change schedule details, black out times, manage and approve reservations.</p>

                <h3>Schedule Availability</h3>
                <p>If a schedule should only be available for a limited period of time, such as a season or semester, you can
                    set the schedule availability. No reservations will be allowed outside of the availability date range.
                </p>

                <h3>Multiple Bookings at the Same Time</h3>
                <p>If you want a resource to be able to be booked by multiple people at the same time, you can configure
                    the schedule to allow multiple reservations concurrently. This setting applies to all resources on a schedule
                    This will no longer allow anyone to access the Schedule view for this schedule.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="help-resources">
                <h2>Setting up Resources</h2>

                <p>You can view and manage resources from the Resources menu option. Here you can change the attributes and
                    usage
                    configuration of a resource.
                </p>

                <p>Resources in             can be anything you want to make bookable, such as rooms or equipment. Every
                    resource
                    must be assigned to a schedule in order for it to be bookable. The resource will inherit whatever layout the
                    schedule uses.</p>

                <p>Setting a minimum reservation duration will prevent booking from lasting shorter than the set amount. The
                    default is
                    no minimum.</p>

                <p>Setting a maximum reservation duration will prevent booking from lasting longer than the set amount. The
                    default is
                    no maximum.</p>

                <p>Setting a resource to require approval will place all bookings for that resource into a pending state until
                    approved.
                    The default is no approval required.</p>

                <p>Setting a resource to automatically grant permission to it will grant all new users permission to access the
                    resource
                    at registration time. The default is to automatically grant permissions.</p>

                <p>You can require a booking lead time by setting a resource to require a certain number of days/hours/minutes
                    notification. For example, if it is currently 10:30 AM on a Monday and the resource requires 1 days
                    notification,
                    the resource will not be able to be booked until 10:30 AM on Sunday. The default is that reservations can be
                    made up
                    until the current time.</p>

                <p>You can prevent resources from being booked too far into the future by requiring a maximum notification of
                    days/hours/minutes. For example, if it is currently 10:30 AM on a Monday and the resource cannot end more
                    than 1 day
                    in the future, the resource will not be able to be booked past 10:30 AM on Tuesday. The default is no
                    maximum.</p>

                <p>Certain resources can have a usage capacity. For example, some conference rooms may only hold up to 8 people.
                    Setting the resource capacity will prevent any more than the configured number of participants at one time,
                    excluding the organizer. The default is that resources have unlimited capacity.</p>

                <p>Requiring check in/check out will give the reservation owner the opportunity to record when they actually
                    begin and end a reservation. You can optionally automatically release a reserved time if a user does not
                    check in within a given amount of time. To automatically release reservations you must configure the
                    autorelease job.</p>

                <p>Application Administrators and applicable Schedule and Resource Administrators are exempt from usage
                    constraints.</p>

                <h3>Resource Administrators</h3>

                <p>A group of users may be set up with permission to manage resources. In order for a group to be set as the
                    resource administrator the group must first
                    be granted the Resource Administrator role. This is configured from the Groups admin tool. Once that role
                    has been added, the group will be
                    available in the Manage Resources tool.</p>

                <p>Resource Administrators have the same capabilities as Application Administrators for any resource which the
                    group is assigned to. They can change
                    resource details, black out times, manage and approve reservations.</p>

                <h3>Resource Images</h3>

                <p>You can set a resource image which will be displayed when viewing resource details from the
                    reservation
                    page.
                    This
                    requires php_gd2 to be installed and enabled in your php.ini file. <a

                    <h3>Resource Statuses</h3>
                    <p>Setting a resource to the Available status will allow users with permission to book the reservation. The
                        Unavailable status will show the resource on
                        the schedule but will not allow it to be booked by anyone other than administrators. The Hidden status
                        will remove the resource from the schedule
                        and prevent bookings from all users.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div id="help-resource-groups">
                <h3>Resource Groups</h3>

                <p>Resource Groups are a simple way to organize and filter resources. When a booking is being created, the user
                    will have an option to book all
                    resources in a group. If resources in a group are assigned to different schedules then only the resources
                    which share a schedule will be booked
                    together.</p>

                <p>If using resource groups, each resource must be assigned to at least one group. Due to the group hierarchy,
                    unassigned resources will not be able to
                    be reserved.</p>

                <p>Drag and drop resource groups to reorganize.</p>

                <p>Right click a resource group name for additional actions.</p>

            <div id="help-resource-types">
                <h3>Resource Types</h3>

                <p>Resource types allow resources that share a common set of attributes to be managed together. Custom
                    attributes for a resource type will apply to all
                    resources of that type</p>
            </div>

            <div id="help-accessories">
                <h2>Setting up Accessories</h2>

                <p>Accessories can be thought of as ancillary resources used during a reservation. Examples may be projectors or
                    chairs in a
                    conference room.</p>

                <p>Accessories can be viewed and managed from the Accessories menu item, under the Resources menu item. Setting
                    a
                    accessory quantity will prevent more than that number of accessories from being booked at a time.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="help-quotas">
                <h2>Setting up Quotas</h2>

                <p>Quotas restrict reservations from being booked based on a configurable limit. The quota system in             is
                    very flexible, allowing you to build limits based on reservation length and number reservations.</p>

                <p>Quota limits &quot;stack&quot;. For example, if a quota exists limiting a resource to 5 hours per day and
                    another quota exists limiting to
                    4 reservations per day, a user would be able to make 4 one-hour-long reservations but would be restricted
                    from making 3
                    two-hour-long reservations. This allows powerful quota combinations to be built.</p>

                <p>Quotas applied to a group are enforced for each user in the group individually. It does not apply to the
                    group's aggregated reservations.</p>

                <p>If you choose to not include past reservations in the quota rules, the quota rule will only include current and
                    future reservations in it's calculation.</p>

                <p>It is important to remember that quota limits are enforced based on the schedule's timezone. For example, a
                    daily limit would begin and end at
                    midnight of the schedule's timezone; not the user's timezone.</p>

                <p>Application Administrators are exempt from quota limits.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="help-announcements">
                <h2>Setting up Announcements</h2>

                <p>Announcements are a very simple way to display notifications to             users.</p>

                <p>From the Announcements menu item
                    you can view and manage the announcements that are displayed on users dashboards. An announcement can be
                    configured
                    with an optional start and end date. An optional priority level is also available, which sorts announcements
                    from 1
                    to 10.</p>

                <p>Announcements can be restricted to users in certain groups by setting a list of groups for the announcement. You can
                    also restrict announcements to users who have permission to specific resources.
                </p>

                <p>HTML is allowed within the announcement text. This allows you to embed links or images from anywhere on the
                    web.</p>

            <div id="help-groups">
                <h2>Setting up Groups</h2>

                <p>Groups in             organize users, control resource access permissions and define roles within the
                    application. Setting resource permissions for a group will grant access to all members of that group. Users
                    can individually be granted additional
                    resource permission.</p>

                <h3>Roles</h3>

                <p>Roles give a group of users the authorization to perform certain actions.</p>

                    Administrator
                    role are
                    open to
                    full administrative privileges. This role has nearly zero restrictions on what resources can be
                    booked.
                    It
                    can
                    manage all aspects of the application.</p>

                <p><em>Group Administrator:</em> Users that belong to a group that is given the Group Administrator role
                    are
                    able to
                    manage
                    their groups and reserve on behalf of and manage users within that group. A group administrator must
                    first
                    be assigned the Group Administrator role.
                    This group will then be available in the Group Administrators list.</p>

                <p><em>Resource Administrator:</em> Users that belong to a group that is given the Resource
                    Administrators
                    role
                    have the
                    same capabilities as Application
                    Administrators for any resource which the group is assigned to. They can change resource details,
                    black
                    out
                    times, manage and approve
                    reservations.</p>

                <p><em>Schedule Administrator:</em> Users that belong to a group that is given the Schedule

                    role
                    have the
                    same capabilities as Application
                    Administrators for any resource that is on a schedule which the group is assigned to. They can

                <h2>Managing Reservations</h2>

                <p>You can view and manage reservations from the Reservations menu item. By default you will see the last 14
                    days and the
                    next 14 days worth of reservations. This can be filtered more or less granular depending on what you are
                    looking for.
                    This tool allows you to quickly find an act on a reservation. You can also export the list of filtered
                    reservations
                    to CSV format for further reporting.</p>

                <h3>Reservation Approval</h3>

                <p>Setting $conf['settings']['reservation']['updates.require.approval'] to true will put all reservation
                    requests into a
                    pending state. The reservation becomes active only after an administrator approves it. From the Reservations
                    admin
                    tool an administrator will be able to view and approve pending reservations. Pending reservations will be
                    highlighted.</p>

                <h3>Reservation Colors</h3>

                <p>Reservation colors can be set for individual users, resources, or dynamically based on a custom attribute
                    value. The slot background color of a reservation on the Schedule and Calendar views will be
                    displayed in this color.</p>

                <h3>Blackout Times</h3>

                <p>Blackout Times can be used to prevent reservations from being booked at certain times. This feature is
                    helpful when a resource is temporarily
                    unavailable or unavailable at a scheduled recurring interval. Blacked out times are not bookable by anyone,

                <p>You can add, view, and manage all registered users from the Users menu item. This tool allows you to change
                    resource
                    access permissions of individual users, assign users to groups, deactivate or delete accounts, reset user
                    passwords, and edit user details.
                    You can also add new users to, which is especially useful if self-registration is turned
                    off.</p>

                <p>Users must have permission to book resources. You can grant permission directly to a user, or you can
                    set permissions at the group level. A user will inherit all permissions of the groups they belong to.</p>

                    Reservations, Resources, Resource Types and
                    Users.</p>

                <p>Attributes can be configured as single line text box, a multi-line text box, a select list (drop
                    down),
                    or a
                    checkbox. All attributes can be
                    configured to be required. Textbox attributes allow an optional validation expression to be set.
                    This
                    value
                    must be a valid regular expression. For
                    example, to require a digit to be entered the validation expression would be <em>/\d+/</em></p>

                <p>User, Resource, and Resource Type attributes can be limited to a single entity. These attributes will have an
                    Applies To property. If an attribute is
                    configured to apply to a single entity then it will only be collected for that entity.</p>

                <p>Reservation attributes will be collected during the reservation process. To collect an attribute value only
                    for
                    specific users or resources, check the 'Collect In Specific Cases' option and pick the cases when the
                    attribute
                    should be shown.</p>

                <p>User attributes are collected when registering and updating a user's profile.</p>

                <p>Resources attributes are entered when managing resources and will be displayed when viewing resource
                    details.</p>

                <p>Resource Type attributes are entered when managing resource types and will be displayed when viewing resource
                    details.</p>

                <p>Admin only attributes are only shown to users who have administrative privileges over that reservation.</p>

                <p>Private attributes are only shown to the reservation owner and those users who have administrative privileges
                    over that reservation.</p>

                    Common Reports which can be viewed as a list of results, a chart, exported to CSV and printed. In addition,
                    ad-hoc
                    reports can be created from the Create New Report menu item. This also allows listing, charting, exporting
                    and
                    printing. In addition, custom reports can be saved and accessed again at a later time from the My Saved
